# Emotion Analysis ML Model

## Overview

This project features a custom-built Machine Learning model designed to assess user emotions from their input. The model assigns scores for emotions like sadness, anger, joy, surprise, fear, and love based on user responses to a series of questions about their day. It computes the average emotion scores and presents the results using pie charts and bar plots, offering insights into the user's emotional state.

## Features

- Analyzes user emotions from text input using a web api.
- Integrates with a user-friendly React front-end for easy input.
- Utilizes Flask as a back-end to process and serve model predictions.
- Plots using chart.js

## Model

The ML model is built from scratch using Python's scikit-learn, nltk and tensorflow library.The model keeps lstm and conv1D layer.
